## Results <a name="results"></a>
There is a large range of prices Seattle home owners demand for their services. Some amenities seem to have a large impact on prices despite being quite cheap. These amenities are a prudent investment.Most offerings are located near the city center, with a drop of prices and the number of offerings farther away
